- Website for [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsa4) (4th Edition) by R.H. Shumway and D.S. Stoffer. Springer Texts in Statistics, 2017.

> You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension...    a dimension of sound, a dimension of sight, a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance, of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into...  T i M e &nbsp; S e R i e S  &nbsp; a N a L y S i S

- Website for [Time Series: A Data Analysis Approach Using R](https://github.com/nickpoison/tsda) by R.H. Shumway and D.S. Stoffer. Chapman &amp; Hall, 2019.

> There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man's fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call  T i M e &nbsp; S e R i e S.
